# Setup

This should prepare you for developing the app.

## Translations

Before you build the app, you can download the current translations.

1. Install [Transifex client][tx-client].
2. Go to the repository root
   ```
   cd mundraub-android
   ```
3. Pull the latest translations. You may need to log in or get an API key.
   ```
   tx pull --all
   ```
